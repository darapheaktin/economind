# Economind
## Economic Models and Python

The primary objective of this new section of Economind is to introduce the use of progamming language - in particular, Python - to make
economic concepts and models more intuitive and approachable. To those who have just begun to step into the realm of 
economics, I also want to show you how economics employs modern tools to gain a deeper insight and more concrete knowledge
of the economic system and the world as a whole.

I consider myself to be an amateur when it comes to coding as will be reflected in the codes I wrote. However, I have been 
learning and using statistical softwares (e.g., Stata) and programming languages (e.g., Python) everyday for my own research. 
I have grown to love both. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. I hope to take you along my journey and this section 
of Economind is dedicated for this purpose.
